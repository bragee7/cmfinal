# ZELDA - Women Safety Guardian (Mobile)

Flutter Android app for the Women Safety Guardian system. Feature-parity mobile
port of the React web app, including the 24/7 background voice listener.

## Features

### User Dashboard
- SOS alert with 5s cancel window, 3-2-1 countdown, and automatic 30s video + audio recording
- Fresh GPS location captured and sent with each alert
- Live location tracking (30s updates) after an alert is sent
- Emergency contacts CRUD
- Media preview after recording

### Voice Protection (24/7)
- Two-stage offline detection with sherpa-onnx: Zipformer KWS spots the
  trigger phrase, Moonshine tiny-en confirms the transcript before firing
- Runs in a foreground service (`flutter_background_service`) with a persistent
  notification, using the `microphone` foreground type
- **Auto-starts on login** for user accounts (requests `RECORD_AUDIO` +
  `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` at runtime via `permission_handler`); stops on logout
- Keywords: "help me", "emergency", "save me"
- On keyword detection while the app is backgrounded, a full-screen intent
  notification brings the app to the foreground to trigger the SOS flow
- Models download on first run (~120 MB: KWS + Moonshine STT) into the app
  support directory (`sherpa_models/`), so the APK stays small
- The dashboard switch reflects the real foreground-service status and surfaces
  startup errors (e.g. missing `RECORD_AUDIO` permission)

### Verified on a real device (Redmi Note 13)
- Voice auto-start after login: foreground service with `microphone` type +
  persistent notification confirmed; the dashboard switch reflects live state
- Real-mic keyword test: saying "help me" triggered the full SOS flow
  (cancel window → countdown → 30s recording → upload) and created a case with
  live GPS; the case appeared on the police dashboard with the LIVE tracking badge
- The live location card populates on the dashboard via the background position watch

### Police Dashboard
- Real-time case list via Socket.IO
- Case details with video/audio playback, location link, and Google Maps open
- Add/update case notes
- Mark cases Pending/Resolved and reopen resolved cases
- Export case report as PDF (Android print dialog)

## Requirements
- Flutter SDK 3.x (Dart 3.x)
- Android emulator or device (API 26+ recommended)
- Backend running on the host at port 5000 (see repo root README)

## Run

```bash
cd mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

To point the app at a different backend, override the base URL at build time
(uses `https://zelda-api-kbtl.onrender.com` by default):

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:5000
```

### Voice service prerequisites on emulator
- `RECORD_AUDIO` and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` runtime permissions. Grant manually if
  the system dialog was skipped:
  ```
  adb shell pm grant com.zelda.zelda_guardian android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO
  adb shell pm grant com.zelda.zelda_guardian android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS
  ```
- First toggle of "24/7 Voice Protection" extracts the bundled model (takes ~1-2s).

## Demo accounts
- Police: `police@guardian.com` / `police123`
- User: `user@guardian.com` / `user123`

## Known limitations
- Keyword detection cannot be exercised on the Android emulator (no real mic
  input); verified at the integration level: model loads, grammar is applied
  (`help me`, `emergency`, `save me`), recognizer starts, and mic is active.
- The pulsing SOS button glow animation continuously redraws; on an emulator this
  keeps CPU elevated. Acceptable on device.
